# Pomodoro Timer Application

A simplified version of Cirillo's original Pomodoro technique, a time-management method which involves using a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks designed to be a great study tool enabling a user to set a focus duration and a break duration.

### Highlights
* The initial screen lets the user set the length of the focus and break and break sessions
* After the user clicks the "play" button, the buttons to change the focus and break duration are disabled, and the session timer appears
* If the user clicks the "pause" button, "paused" appears below the time remaining
